# workout-api-mern-backend

1- Before deploying in Render.com in my local host frontend and backend are working toghether fine . Now backend is not properly working on Render.com. I will try again tomorrow.

2- I changed folders/ files name and also some codings and styling as per my layman/idiot understanding.
